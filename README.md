# CartoHub Frontend

## Features (not implemented)

- CartoHub is not a geo-referencing app, but a map image archive and tile delivery infrastructure
- A geo-referencing app frontend is just attached to the delivery infrastructure
- Cloud-native, with high availability and scalability
- Users can operate via the app interface/API
- Users can upload map images
- Users can geo-reference the map
- Users can fork other users' maps. While MapWarper had a 1:1 ratio between maps and geo-references, allowing forking makes it possible to have a 1:n ratio between maps and geo-references
- Mosaic feature, enables what Hinata GIS did with the gaihozu maps, without relying on such external users
- Geo-reference is just one function. Should we provide plugin-like spatial operations within StepFunctions?
